## Why useEffect ?

It's clear that useEffect is one of the most commonly used hooks in React. If you go through 10 React course, all of them will likely mention to `useEffect`. React itself also emphasizes the important of `useEffect` - its official documentation includes five dedicated sections just discussing about how to handle side effect in React. Despite its popularity, `useEffect` seem like not friendly with React community. In fact, there’s been a growing discussion among experts who are trying to convince others to "Say Goodbye to `useEffect`." So, what’s going on with `useEffect`? Let’s break it down together.

## Is useEffect unintuitive ?

When discussing why a function might feel unintuitive, we might think that its document isn't clear enough in explaining its purpose. However, it’s not a case for `useEffect`. Let’s have a look in React document about the definition of `useEffect`

> useEffect is a React Hook that lets you [synchronize a component with an external system.](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

What's the heck is `external system` ? 
If you scroll down a bit then you will find the definition for this term

> Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called _external.

So by theory, in React `useEffect` is created when you want to synchronize internal state (state is created by our code - useState, useContext) with external state (local storage, network, etc..). 

However, in reality, `useEffect` is considered as a powerful tools for hooking into the initialization of component, or watching changes **<u>not only in internal data but also in external data</u>**.

Let’s take a look on this example. Let's say we want to create a custom hook usePrevious to get the previous data when state change to new value.

With FE mindset, it’s very intuitive to come up with a solution listening on the changes of state by using `useEffect`, much like the [approach taken by libraries such as `react-use`](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/src/usePrevious.ts).

```jsx
export default function usePrevious<T>(state: T): T | undefined {
  const ref = useRef<T>();

  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = state;
  });

  return ref.current;
}
```

It’s make sense but it’s the thing React doesn’t want us to do. By definition, we should only `useEffect` when we need to sync with **<u>external state</u>**, however, in this scenario no external involved.

Instead, we need to solve the problem as same as the approach of [useHook library](https://github.com/uidotdev/usehooks/blob/90fbbb4cc085e74e50c36a62a5759a40c62bb98e/index.js#L1017)
```jsx
export function usePrevious(value) {
  const [current, setCurrent] = React.useState(value);
  const [previous, setPrevious] = React.useState(null);

  if (value !== current) {
    setPrevious(current);
    setCurrent(value);
  }

  return previous;
}

```

In this code, we call two `setState` functions. However, React is very efficient at batching state updates—it will calculate the changes and renders only once.

Because `useEffect` is very power, easily to overuse in wrong way and addicted that make some developer in React community don't like it. Beside, if you overuse useEffect in a wrong way you may encounters some problems

## What if we continue useEffect in a wrong way ?

`useEffect` is clearly a good tool for handling side effect, however, if we don't use it properly we may encounter some issues

### Your app may got performance issue
Keep using `useEffect` as a tracking tool for all purpose may let your brain lazy in coming up better solution to solve the need.

Let’s have a look on this example
You're received a task building the search filter. If you overuse `useEffect`, you may come up with the solution like this
```jsx
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState("");
  const [filteredItems, setFilteredItems] = React.useState(items);
  
  useEffect(()=>{
	  setFilteredItems(
		  MOCK_DATA.filter((item) =>
		      item.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm)
		)
	)
  }, [searchTerm])
  
  const handleSearch = (e)=>{
    setSearchTerm(e.target.value)
  }
```

Unfortunately, it’s not a good approach as your application have to render twice when keyword changes
- First render for setSearchTerm call in handleSearch function
- After searchTerm is updated to expected value, `useEffect` will be called and invoke setFilteredItems and trigger second render

Instead, we can batch the state updates into one, as React is very efficient at rendering. Even if we call two `setState` functions simultaneously, they only trigger a single render with this approach.

```jsx
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState("");
  const [filteredItems, setFilteredItems] = React.useState(items);

  const handleSearch = (e)=>{
    const newvalue = e.target.value
    
    setSearchTerm(newvalue)
    const result = items.filter((item) =>
      item.toLowerCase().includes(newvalue.toLowerCase())
    );
    setFilteredItems(result);
  }
```

### Inconsistence in coding style
Imagine you’re working in a team where they're very good in React and you use `useEffect` like a tracking tools for all purpose. As a result, it will make your college are not happy and it’s might impact to your promotion

### useEffect remains unintuitive
Yes, if we don't use `useEffect` correctly, you might encounter bugs due to its unintuitive behavior, as shown in the image below.

The reason for above bug come from overusing of `useEffect` then the author doesn't know when `useEffect` is invoked in React render lifecycle (TLDR: React will only render when state change → After render, React will start invoking `useEffect` function to handle side-effect)
If you understand React render lifecycle you may realize the pathname inside `useEffect` code will always be the latest value (not the previous one)

## What is the good example for correct usage of `useEffect`
 As we mention earlier `useEffect` is created for handling side-effect, so we expect code inside `useEffect` should be related to side-effect (updating DOM, managing localStorage, calling API, etc..)
 In below example, we're trying to build a component that can help us update the tab title by clicking different button
 We need `useEffect` in this scenario to help us synchronize the data between internal state (React state) and external state (window.document.title)

```jsx
function DocumentTitleChanger() {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('Default Title');

  useEffect(() => {
    // This will run every time "title" changes.
    document.title = title;
  }, [title]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Change Document Title</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setTitle('Title One')}>Title One</button>
      <button onClick={() => setTitle('Title Two')}>Title Two</button>
      <button onClick={() => setTitle('Title Three')}>Title Three</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That it’s for this post. I hope this post can help you understand more about `useEffect` and help you use `useEffect` in a more correct ways. Mastering side-effect is not an easy task in React, please let's me know your attention by follow / react on this post. If you find it useful, I will work on writing more post in the future for mastering side-effect
